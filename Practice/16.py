# Exercise 16
# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - 
# strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
# The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 
# Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:
# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

import myFunctions

passSize = myFunctions.getInt('How many characters would you like your password to have?')
print(f'Password ðŸ™Š: {myFunctions.passwordGenerator(passSize)}')

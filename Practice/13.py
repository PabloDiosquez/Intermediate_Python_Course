# Exercise 13
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. 
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. 
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence 
# is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

import myFunctions

def fibo(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1: return 1
    return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)

def generateFiboSequence(n: int) -> list:
    sequence= []
    for i in range(n):
        sequence.append(fibo(i))
    return sequence

print(generateFiboSequence(myFunctions.getInt('How many Fibonacci numbers in the sequence?')))
